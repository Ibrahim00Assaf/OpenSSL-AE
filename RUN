openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -e -in helloworld.txt -k hi -pbkdf2 -a

//AES-256-cbc – Specifies the encryption algorithm  (CBC)
-in helloworld.txt – Specifies the include file
-k hi – setting the encryption key to any arbitrary term of choice. (for experimental purposes, this was kept as easy as possible.) 
-pbkdf2 – Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 
Securely hashes a password for X amount of iterations
-a – Base64 encodes the output//
