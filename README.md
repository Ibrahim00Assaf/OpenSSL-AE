# OpenSSL-AES
Key generation, Encryption, and Decryption.
OPENSSL Command that allows encryption / decryption of a key that can be included via .txt or plaintext, which will output an encrypted key that uses your given passphrase. This passphrase can be paired with PBKDF2 if needed which can help with brute-force attacks. This command is only used to simulate key generation and possibly benchmark the CPU.
